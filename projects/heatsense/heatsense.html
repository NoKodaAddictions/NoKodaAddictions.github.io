                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p class="textbox">
                    Many kids are unknowingly being locked inside a car and consequently dying due to heat.
                    in 2019, a whopping 51 cases were reported! These issues occur since parents don't think
                    that this situation would happen to them.
                </p>
                <h2>How Hot Can a Car Get?</h2>
                <p class="textbox">
                    Given enough time, a vehicle's internal temperature can spike to about 172â„‰. A test was conducted by Kars 4 Kids 
                    to raise awareness of leaving children in hot cars. They asked random people to sit in a parked car for about 10 minutes. 
                    They went in, confident they could sit for that long. But, as time progressed, their confidence turned into worry. 
                    Many tried to open the windows, fan themselves, etc but to no avail. Eventually, all participants failed.
                    If that wasn't enough, they put cookie dough on the wind shield. They baked after some time.

                <h2>Current Solutions</h2>
                <p class="textbox">
                    Currently, There are 3 different solutions. Sensorsafe, General Motors Rear Seat Reminder Ssytem, And Driver's Little Helper.
                    Although these solutions are good, there are some limitations. With Sensorsafe, the costs for the booster seats are very expensive.
                    For General Motors, the system only works if the back door was opened and is only in select cars such as Chevorlet, Cadillac,
                    and GMC. Driver's Little helper on the other hand takes about 1 minute to send a notification to the driver. By the time it is sent,
                    the driver may be a few meters away (maybe in a grocery store, etc)
                </p>
                <h2>Criteria And Constraints</h2>
                <p>If I am going to create a device to solve this problem, this device needs to be:</p>
                <div class="grid" style="text-align:left;">
                    <p>1: Compact And Portable -> Easier for drivers to place the module<br><br>
                        2: Heat Resistant -> To make sure the module doesn't short out from the rising heat.<br><br>
                        3: Cost -> Has to be cheap so many people can afford it
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h2>My Solution</h2>

                <p class="textbox">This is the prototype I created. It uses a motion sensor and a temperature sensor to detect and 
                    measure motion and ambient temperature.<br><br>
                    After the system boots up, it will check to see if the temperature has gone above 25 deg C
                    (above room temperature). If so, then the next step would be to check for motion.
                    If motion is detected, then the system plays an alarm and will send an SMS message to the connected device.
