        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            Many children are being left inside cars unknowingly and consequently dying due to an immense amount of heat. <br>
            In 2019, a whopping 51 cases were reported! Reason being that they don't think this kind of situation will happen to them <br> 
         </p>
         <h2> How Hot Can A Car Get? </h2>
            
         <p>
            Given enough time, a vehicle's internal temperature can spike to about 172â„‰. Almost like an oven! Speaking of ovens. A test <br> was
            conducted by Kars For Kids about the awareness of leaving children in hot cars. They asked random people to sit in <br> a parked car for
            about 10 minutes. All of them went in, confident they could sit for that long. That is what happened at first. <br> But, as time progressed,
            they attempted to open the windows but to no avail. Some tried to fan themselves to keep cool. <br> Every single person that took the test failed.
            If that wasn't enough, Kars For Kids also put cookie dough on the dashboard of <br> the car. Some time later, the cookies had finished baking.
         </p>
         <h2>Current Solutions</h2>
         <p>Currently, There are 3 different solutions. Sensorsafe, General Motors Rear Seat Reminder Ssytem, And Driver's Little Helper. <br> Although these solutions are good,
            there are some limitations. With Sensorsafe, the costs for the booster seats are very expensive. <br> For General Motors, the system only works if the back door was opened
            and is only in select cars such as Chevorlet, Cadillac, <br> and GMC. Driver's Little helper on the other hand takes about 1 minute to send a notification to
            the driver. By the time it is sent, <br> the driver may be a few meters away (maybe in a grocery store, etc).
        </p>
        <h2>Criteria And Constraints</h2>
        <p>
            If I am going to create a device to solve this problem, this device needs to be: <br>
            1: Compact And Portable - Easier for drivers to place the module <br>
            2: Heat Resistant - To make sure the module doesn't short out from the rising heat. <br>
            3: Cost - Has to be cheap so many people can afford it 
        </p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <img class="image" height="200" width="275" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=14cLHR8lkz3QdCrNgTB2447CL9LGzs3AN"> <img class="image" height="200" width="325" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=19UJrkVSvYbcJphXxKgb8e3BtiJP1uKH5">
        <p>
            This is the current solution I created. It uses a motion sensor and a temperature sensor to detect people inside the car.
            Basically, <br> if the system detects a hot temperature, it will check to see if there is motion inside the car. If so, sound an alarm.
    
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2>System Hardware And Connections:</h2>
        <p>
                1: Raspberry Pi 3 <br>
                2: DHT22 Temperature/Humidity Sensor <br>
                3: PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor <br>
                4: Speaker
